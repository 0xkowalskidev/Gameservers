# Gameserver Management Control Panel

## Overview
A minimal, Docker-based gameserver management control panel built with Go, HTMX, and Tailwind CSS. Similar to Pterodactyl but focusing on simplicity and locality of behavior.

## Core Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Go with Chi router and zerolog for structured logging
- **Frontend**: HTMX + Tailwind CSS (embedded static files)
- **Container Runtime**: Docker API with automatic image pulling
- **Database**: SQLite with database/sql
- **Package Manager**: Nix flake

### Design Principles
1. **Single Binary**: Everything compiled into one executable
2. **Locality of Behavior**: Keep related code together
3. **Minimal File Structure**: Avoid excessive directory nesting
4. **Template Files**: HTML templates in templates/ directory
5. **Simple State Management**: SQLite for persistence, in-memory for runtime
6. **No Authentication**: Direct access (handle externally if needed)

## Features

### Phase 1: Core Functionality
- [x] Docker container management (start/stop/restart)
- [x] Real-time console output (via SSE log streaming)
- [x] Resource monitoring via SSE (CPU, RAM)
- [x] Gameserver CRUD

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
- [x] Advanced file manager with editor
- [x] Backup/restore functionality
- [x] Schedule tasks (restarts, backups)
- [ ] RCON console integration

### Phase 3: Future File Manager Enhancements
- [ ] File upload functionality (drag & drop support)
- [ ] Multi-select for batch file operations
- [ ] File preview for logs and text files
- [ ] Zip archive operations (create/extract)
- [ ] Move/cut files and directories between folders

## Current TODOs
- [ ] Docker image pull policy - Currently Docker only pulls if image doesn't exist locally, even if remote image is updated. Need to decide on pull strategy (Always, IfNotPresent, Never, or user-configurable)

## API Design (HTMX-focused)

### Implemented Routes
- `GET /` - List gameservers (dashboard)
- `POST /` - Create gameserver
- `GET /new` - Create gameserver form
- `GET /{id}` - Show gameserver details
- `POST /{id}/start` - Start gameserver
- `POST /{id}/stop` - Stop gameserver  
- `POST /{id}/restart` - Restart gameserver
- `DELETE /{id}` - Delete gameserver

### RESTful Handler Naming
- `IndexGameservers()`, `NewGameserver()`, `CreateGameserver()`
- `ShowGameserver()`, `DestroyGameserver()`

## Gameserver Images

### Structure
Each gameserver has its own directory under `gameservers/` containing:
- `Dockerfile` - Image definition
- Startup script - start.sh
- Other standardised files needed for gameserver management

### Image Naming Convention
- Registry: `ghcr.io/0xkowalskidev/gameservers`
- Format: `ghcr.io/0xkowalskidev/gameservers/GAME:VERSION`
- Example: `ghcr.io/0xkowalskidev/gameservers/minecraft:1.20.4`

## Testing Strategy

### Principles
- **Minimal**: Only test critical paths and complex logic
- **Maintainable**: Tests should be easy to update as code changes
- **High Impact**: Focus on areas that would cause significant issues if broken

### Test Structure
- Each file has an associated `_test.go` file (except main.go/other untestable files)
- Example: `docker.go` → `docker_test.go`
- Use table-driven tests for multiple scenarios
- Mock external dependencies (Docker API, SQLite)

### What NOT to Test
- Simple getters/setters
- Direct Docker API calls (trust the Docker client library)
- HTML template rendering (visual testing)
- Third-party library internals

## Development Scripts (via Nix)
```bash
# Enter development shell
nix develop

# Run development server with hot reload and Tailwind compilation
nix run .#dev
# or just 'dev' in the shell

# Run tests with richgo (colored output)
nix run .#test
# dont use 'test' in the shell as its overwritten by internals
```
## Notes
- Use Chi middleware for request logging
- Templates use Go html/template package
- SSE connections auto-reconnect on failure
- WebSocket has heartbeat for connection health
- Consider using Alpine.js for light interactivity
- File operations use Docker cp API

## Memories
- Call it Gameserver or Gameservers, not GameServer or Server
